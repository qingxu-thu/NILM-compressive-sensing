# Sparse NILM
Copyright (c) 2015 by Stephen Makonin

The super-state hidden Markov model disaggregator that uses a sparse Viterbi algorithm for decoding. This project contains the source code that was use for my [IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid](http://makonin.com/doc/TSG_2015.pdf) journal paper.

## piNILM

**2016 May 2 Update:** This code is able to run on a Raspberry Pi 2B+ and 3. If you have a [Rainforest EMU2](https://rainforestautomation.com/rfa-z105-2-emu-2/) you can have the RPi communicate with your smart meter and perform disaggregation in real-time. Read the [piNILM.md](piNILM.md) document for details on how to do this.
